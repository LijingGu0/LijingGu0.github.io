Address:  Ï€ Space building, [Tapani Ristaniemi[School of Innovation and Entrepreneurship of DUT](http://chuangxin.dlut.edu.cn/English.htm), 
Topic: ["Brain Domain EEG/ERP Camp Season 1"](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/4S5ojcby61VQtRdE8AfSbQ). My responsibility was to teach trainees how to use time-frequency analysis to process ERP data and 
extract the event-related oscillations from the time-frequency representation distributions.
