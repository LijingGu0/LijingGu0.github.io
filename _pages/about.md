- I am a Ph.D. student in [Faculty of Information Technology](https://www.jyu.fi/it/en), [University of Jyväskylä](https://jyu.fi/en), and visiting Ph.D.student in [School of Biomedical Engineering](http://bme.dlut.edu.cn/), [Dalian University of Technology](http://en.dlut.edu.cn/), working with Prof. [Tapani Ristaniemi](http://users.jyu.fi/~riesta/) and Prof. [Fengyu Cong](http://www.escience.cn/people/cong/index.html). I am a member of [SPWC lab](https://www.jyu.fi/it/en/research/research-areas/software-and-telecommunication-technology/signal-processing) and [ASAP lab](http://www.escience.cn/people/cong/asap.html).
- I received my master's degree （2015.09-2018.06）from [Dalian University of Technology](http://en.dlut.edu.cn/) and the supervisor is Prof. [Fengyu Cong](http://www.escience.cn/people/cong/index.html). I obtained my bachelor's degree （2011.09-2015.06） from [Dalian Polytechnic University](http://en.dlpu.edu.cn/).
