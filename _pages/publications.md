1.An emotional ERP data and Matlab script codes
------   
* **Experimental paradigm:** Within-subject design with two-factor: Valence (extreme, moderate, and neutral) x Negative-category (disgusting and fearful) and the details can be found in [(Lu et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1080/17470919.2015.1120238)
* **Subjects:** [Sub#1](../_publications/Evoked ERP ERO_v1.1 Demo data.zip);[Sub#2](../_publications/Evoked ERP ERO_v1.1 Demo data.zip); [Sub#3](../_publications/Evoked ERP ERO_v1.1 Demo data.zip); [Sub#4](../_publications/Evoked ERP ERO_v1.1 Demo data.zip);[Sub#5](../_publications/Evoked ERP ERO_v1.1 Demo data.zip); [Sub#6](../_publications/Evoked ERP ERO_v1.1 Demo data.zip);[Sub#7](../_publications/Evoked ERP ERO_v1.1 Demo data.zip);[Sub#8](../_publications/Evoked ERP ERO_v1.1 Demo data.zip);[Sub#9](../_publications/Evoked ERP ERO_v1.1 Demo data.zip);[Sub#10](../_publications/Evoked ERP ERO_v1.1 Demo data.zip);[Sub#11](../_publications/Evoked ERP ERO_v1.1 Demo data.zip);[Sub#12](../_publications/Evoked ERP ERO_v1.1 Demo data.zip); [Sub#13](../_publications/Evoked ERP ERO_v1.1 Demo data.zip); [Sub#14](../_publications/Evoked ERP ERO_v1.1 Demo data.zip);[Sub#15](../_publications/Evoked ERP ERO_v1.1 Demo data.zip); [Sub#16](../_publications/Evoked ERP ERO_v1.1 Demo data.zip);[Sub#17](../_publications/Evoked ERP ERO_v1.1 Demo data.zip);[Sub#18](../_publications/Evoked ERP ERO_v1.1 Demo data.zip);[Sub#19](../_publications/Evoked ERP ERO_v1.1 Demo data.zip);[Sub#20](../_publications/Evoked ERP ERO_v1.1 Demo data.zip).
* **ERP experimental paradigm:** 

* This toolbox provides some advanced signal processing and analysis methods based on temporal principal component analysis (t-PCA)/morlet continuous wavelet transform to rapidly and objectively extract the event-related potential (ERP)/event-related oscillation (ERO) of interest from the averaged ERP dataset at group-level. [Download toolbox: Evoked ERP ERO_V1.1](../_publications/Evoked ERP ERO_v1.1.zip) /[Download demo datasets](../_publications/Evoked ERP ERO_v1.1 Demo data.zip) / [Download codes for forming a fourth-order tensor](../_publications/Evoked ERP ERO_v1.1_Forming_fourth_order_tensor_demo data.zip). Please add EEGLAB, for example, [eeglab14_1_2b](../_publications/eeglab14_1_2b.zip), into Matlab path before use this toolbox to process ERP signals.
* **Signal types for processing:** The averaged signal, a fourth-order tensor, is collected from the within-subject (one-factor, two-factor, three-factor) or between-subject (two-factor, three-factor) experiment designs.  
* **Functions:** Using t-PCA and Promax rotation/continuous wavelet transform to extract the ERPs/EROs of interest from the original input/the filtered signal (FFT filter or wavelet filter), and exporting the data at the specific electrodes with the time-window of interest as an excel file, which can be imported to SPSS.
