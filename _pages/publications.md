Matlab Toolbox
------
1.  **Name:** **ASAP for ERP_v1**
    **Authors:** **Guanghui Zhang** and Fengyu Cong 
    **Introduction:** This toolbox provides some advanced signal processing and analysis methods based on PCA to rapidly and objectively extract the event-related potential (ERP) of interest from the averaged ERP dataset at group-level. [[User Guide](../_publications/ASAP for ERP_v1_User Guide.zip)]/[[Download within-subject design demo](../_publications/ASAP for ERP_v1_withinsubjects_demo.zip)]/ [[Download between-subject design demo](../_publications/ASAP for ERP_v1_betweensubjects_demo.zip)]
    **Signal types for processing:** The averaged signal, a fourth-order tensor, is collected from the within-subject (one-factor, two-factor, three-factor) or between-subject (two-factor, three-factor) experiment designs.  
    **Functions:** Using the temporal principal component analysis (t-PCA) and Promax rotation to extract the components of interest from the original input/the filtered signal (FFT filter or wavelet filter), and exporting the data at the specific electrodes with the time-window of interest as an excel file, which can be imported to SPSS.
    
    
2.  **Name:** **ASAP ERP_ERO_v1**
    **Authors:** **Guanghui Zhang**, Fengyu Cong, and Tapani Ristaniemi 
    **Introduction:** This toolbox provides some advanced signal processing and analysis methods based on temporal principal component analysis (t-PCA)/morlet continuous wavelet transform to rapidly and objectively extract the event-related potential (ERP)/event-related oscillation (ERO) of interest from the averaged ERP dataset at group-level.
